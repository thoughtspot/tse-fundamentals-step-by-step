# Starting source code

This directory contains the code to use for starting your project. It contains the following files:

* index.html - HTML file for the application
* tse.css - style sheet for the application
* tse.js - main application code where most changes will be made
* images/* - images used for this project

You may want to copy this folder (and sub-folder) to a working project location in case you need to revert to the
original. Or you can always do a fresh pull from GitHub.
