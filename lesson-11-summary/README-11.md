# Course Summary

In this course we covered a lot of topics related to embedding ThoughtSpot into your own applications to give the
analytics power to the end users. We covered the high-level concepts such as setup and security, as well as doing
detailed implementations of the different types of embedding. And finally finished up with a discussion of custom
styles.

We hope you enjoyed this course and learned a lot. TSE is an area of key focus for ThoughtSpot, and we continue to add
additional capabilities to give you even more control. You can expect to see updates on a regular (approximately
monthly) basis. To stay abreast of new features, be sure to monitor
the [release notes](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/whats-new) on the developer site.

# Additional Topics

This course focused on embedding ThoughtSpot visualizations. Additional topics you may want to explore that weren't
covered here are. We also offer two additional, instructor led courses.

* [ThoughtSpot Embedded - Advanced Embedding for Javascript Developers](https://training.thoughtspot.com/thoughtspot-embedded-advanced-embedding-for-javascript-developers) -
  This course covers advanced embedding concepts such as trusted authentication, bidirectional messaging, and custom
  actions.
* [ThoughtSpot Embedded - Using ThoughtSpot REST APIs] - This course covers ThoughtSpot REST endpoints with hand's on
  exercises using Python.

## CS Tools

[CS Tools](https://thoughtspot.github.io/cs_tools) is not technically part of ThoughtSpot Embedded. But it's useful
enough to mention here. CS Tools is a community supported set of open source tools that allow you to do things like
extract usage information, automate TML activities, and more easily manage users, etc. See
the [list of tools](https://thoughtspot.github.io/cs_tools/tools/) for the current capabilities. And if you
are interested, you can even contribute ideas and code.
