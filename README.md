# ThoughtSpot Embedding Fundamentals Step-by-Step

Welcome to TSE step-by-step, an introduction to ThoughtSpot Embedding. This is a self-guided course
content. Each section is broken down into a concrete topic along with instructions on the steps to follow and code
examples to let you work on the steps yourself.

## Requirements

This course was created using version 9.10.0.cl. Features are regularly updated, so if you are using a more recent
version, then things may have changed. Please provide feedback in the discussion or issues. You should be on a more
recent version of ThoughtSpot for some features.

## Resources

For this tutorial you will need the following:

* A modern browser. Chrome is recommended, but not required. All examples will use Chrome.
* Access to ThoughtSpot with TSE enabled. If you don't have an account, you can create an account
  at https://thoughtspot.com/trial?tsref=dev=stepbystep.
* A code editor for editing the Javascript code. The examples will
  use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a free editor that works on many operating systems.
* A web server that will host static web content (.html, .css, .js files). The examples will use the Live Server plug-in for Visual Studio Code.
* A basic understanding of ThoughtSpot. This can be obtained by taking introductory courses. See
  the [ThoughtSpot Training site](https://training.thoughtspot.com) for courses you can take to learn the basics.

Ideally you will have some experience with HTML and Javascript, but it's not required.
